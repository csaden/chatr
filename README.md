# Chatr

## Get Started
1. `run yarn install`
2. `npm start`


## Application Side Effects
The application uses [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) as Middleware to manage fetching data and other impure actions.

## Styles
The application uses sass styles sheets which are compiled to css stylesheets for the build files. Co-locate the style sheet for a component and import the component's styles. For Component Foo, `@import ./Foo.css`.
